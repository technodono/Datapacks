# Shelf storage
### (resourcepack included)

some things in life minecraft won't give us like custom furniture or more storage options... This datapack changes that and adds custom storage blocks to minecraft that will allow you to store 5 stacks of items and give your builds a more cosy & custom feel!

I wanted to make these blocks in the most vanilla way possible. This means that each block has a stand-alone texture and can be made from any type of wood like how the barrel & chest are crafted. 

## Current limitations:
due to in game limitations you can only mine these with iron/better pickaxes
the blocks will not burn like most wood blocks
**Any datapacks that _unlock all recipes_ will break this pack!**

## Installing:
Once the data-pack is installed you can verify it's working by clicking on the installed data-packs button or running /data-pack list and checking if it's in the list
