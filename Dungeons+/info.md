# Dungeons+

This data-pack adds over 30 brand new immersive underground dungeons and structures that keep the style of vanilla dungeons but ultimately replace them! Each dungeon type spawns within certain biomes and has a unique spawner which allows for strategic structure exploration.

## Installing:
Once the data-pack is installed you can verify it's working by running /data-pack list and checking if it's in the list

## Standard Dungeon Types
> **Cold Dungeon**: The skeleton's bone cold abode  
> 
> **Mouldy Dungeon**: This is your standard zombie spawner dungeon.
> 
> **Webbed Dungeon**: This dungeon could almost be mistaken for a small fortress... a spider's fortress.
> 
> _[Found in: Plains, Hills, Savannahs, Tiagas]_

## Unique Dungeon Types 
> **Infested Dungeon**: This mountain dungeon has been overtaken by an infestation! make sure you watch your step!
> 
> **Lush Dungeon**: The lush jungles & caves provide a nice home for these cave spiders. Be careful however as the dungeon is very small & cramped.
> 
> **Deepwater Dungeon**: These are usually found below the depths of the ocean and in dripstone caves.
> 
> **Frozen Dungeon**: Wet and cold, this snowy dungeon brings with it a formidable stench from all of the strays.
> 
> **Dusty Tomb**: Mostly dry and sandy. The husk and parched are not very welcoming.
> 
> **Scorched Tomb**: Deep in the badlands these will be found. Dungeons full of zombies, skeletons and loot for those who do a little searching!
> 
> **Muddy Dungeon**: Can be found in the swampy areas of your world and is a haven to many bogged and slimes.

## Other structures
> **Dungeon Ruins**: We don't know how they got here, only that someone has been here already!
