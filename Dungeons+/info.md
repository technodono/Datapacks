# Dungeons+
### (resourcepack included)

This data-pack aims to add 6 brand new dungeons that should improve vanilla immersion and keep the feeling of the old vanilla style dungeon boxes! Each dungeon type spawns within certain biomes and has a unique spawner which allows for strategic structure exploration to find the one spawner you're specifically looking to turn into a farm

## Installing:
Once the data-pack is installed you can verify it's working by clicking on the installed data-packs button or running /data-pack list and checking if it's in the list

## Dungeon Types

**Mouldy Dungeon**: This is your standard zombie spawner dungeon. It can be found mostly in plains biomes and savanna's

**Infested Dungeon**: This mountain dungeon has been overtaken by an infestation! make sure you watch your step!

**Webbed Dungeon**: Found within minecraft's wooded forests, this dungeon is home to many a web and certainty a few spiders!

**Lush Dungeon**: The lush jungles & caves provide a nice home for these cave spiders. Be careful as the dungeon is very small & cramped, It'll make a meal of any guests who enter!

**Deepwater Dungeon**: In the spikiest of caves and the depths of the oceans lies dungeons so wet you could have a swim. However I wouldn't recommend it since the drowned hate sharing the pool with you.

**Cold Dungeon**: The cold of the tiaga is not enough to stop the cold bone bludgers from hanging out, could they even feel the cold in the first place?

**Frozen Dungeon**: Though it is wet, it still makes for a nice atmosphere, except for when the ragged figures shoot at you!

**Dusty Tomb**: Mostly dry and sandy, it also may make you very hungry if you get attacked by it's rotten friends

**Scorched Tomb**: Where it's hot, there's gold! but there also tombs filled with zombies and loot for those who do a little searching!

**Witch Shack**: Well whatever shack was there seems to be gone now. However the witch still remains in peace in her underground lair. How long? who knows. It might have even been flooded at some point!
